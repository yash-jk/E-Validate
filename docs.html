        <br />
        <span class="description"
          >The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), which is the very same
          protocol we all use to move emails on and across networks, is used by
          the emailvalidation.io API to verify email addresses.<br /><br />
          By determining whether the requested domain is set up to accept email,
          our system starts the process of real-time email verification. Here is
          where the MX-Records check in the API is useful. The mx found response
          object of the API will inform you if MX-Records for the specified
          domain have been located.</span

          >In the "did you mean" object of the API result set, the
          emailvalidation.io API will propose a different email address if a
          potential misspelling or mistake in the requested email address's
          domain portion is identified.<br /><br />
          Please be aware that the email address in the did you mean object is
          just a recommendation and has no bearing on the other API response
          objects.</span

        <br />
        <span class="description"
          >One SMTP check is not the end of the real-time verification procedure
          used by the emailvalidation.io API. A catch-all detection mechanism
          has been created since many email servers are set up to catch (accept)
          all incoming mail traffic, independent of the local component of the
          requested email address.<br /><br />
          This functionality is disabled by default due to the significant
          negative impact it has on the API's response time. However, you can
          enable catch-all detection by adding the request URL's catch all
          option and setting it to</span

        <span class="description"
          >Depending on whether the requested email address is discovered to be

          response will either return true or false.</span

        <span class="heading">Disposable Check</span>

        <span class="description"
          >If the requested email address is discovered to be utilizing a
          disposable email service like mailinator.com or trashmail.com, the API
          will also return a disposable JSON object with the values true or
          false.</span

        <span class="heading">Free Email Provider Check</span>
        <br />
        <span class="description"
          >The emailvalidation.io API can recognize free email services like
          Gmail, GMX or Yahoo since it is connected to a regularly updated
          database that lists all available email providers. <br /><br />
          The free JSON object in the API response will either return true or
          false depending on whether the given email address is discovered to be
          utilizing a free service.</span

        <span class="heading">Role Check</span>
        <br />
        <span class="description"
          >Determining whether the requested email address is a role email
          address is another step in the emailvalidation.io email verification
          procedure. A role email is an address that often refers to a function
          rather than a person or name (for example, "support" or "postmaster").
          Due to the low open rates of this sort of email address, it could
          occasionally be undesirable when sending email campaigns. <br /><br />
          Example: If the requested email is a role address, the role JSON
          object in the API response will return true; otherwise, it will return
          false.</span

          (Good), reflecting the quality and deliverability of the given email
          address, to complete the emailvalidation.io validation & verification
          procedure. <br /><br />
          Based on a system that gets smarter with each email address validated,
          this Quality Score is determined for each requested email
          address.</span>
